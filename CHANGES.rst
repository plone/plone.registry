------------------

- Fix a bug in bind() for Choice fields.
  [optilude]


1.0a2 - 2009-07-12
------------------

- Changed API methods and arguments to mixedCase to be more consistent with
  the rest of Zope. This is a non-backwards-compatible change. Our profuse
  apologies, but it's now or never. :-/

  If you find that you get import errors or unknown keyword arguments in your
  code, please change names from foo_bar too fooBar, e.g. for_interface()
  becomes forInterface().
