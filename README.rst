This package provides debconf-like (or about:config-like) settings registries
for Zope applications. A ``registry``, with a dict-like API, is used to get and
set values stored in ``records``. Each record contains the actual value, as
well as a ``field`` that describes the record in more detail. At a minimum, the
field contains information about the type of value allowed, as well as a short
title describing the record's purpose.

See the following doctests for more details: 

* ``registry.rst``, which demonstrates how registries and records work
* ``events.rst``, which shows the events that are fired from the registry
* ``field.rst``, which describes the behaviour of persistent fields
